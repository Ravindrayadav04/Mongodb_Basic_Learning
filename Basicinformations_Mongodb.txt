Introduction:::

What is MongoDB?
MongoDB is a NoSQL document-oriented database. It stores data in JSON-like
documents (actually BSON, a binary form of JSON).


Key Components::

mongod – the main MongoDB server daemon. It handles connections,
database storage, and queries. You must run this before using MongoDB
locally.
mongosh – the MongoDB Shell. It’s the command-line interface for
interacting with MongoDB. You use it to run commands, queries, and scripts.
MongoDB Compass – a GUI tool for visualizing data, running queries, and
analyzing performance. Perfect for beginners who prefer a graphical view.


Basic Mongo Shell Commands::

show dbs                      // List all databases
use ecommerce                // Create or switch to a database
show collections            // List all collections in the current DB
db.dropDatabase()          // Drop current database





Aggregation Pipeline::
Aggregation pipelines in MongoDB are used to analyze and transform data. They
work in stages: each stage performs an operation, and the output of one stage
becomes the input of the next.

Think of it like a factory line:
Each stage takes input (your data)
Performs some operation (like filtering, sorting, grouping)
Sends the result to the next stage



MongoDB Indexes::
Indexes in MongoDB are special data structures that improve the speed of read
operations on a collection. They work similarly to indexes in books, allowing the
database to quickly locate and access the data without scanning every document.

Should you always create indexes?
While indexes improve read performance, they can slow down write operations
(inserts, updates, deletes) because the index must also be updated. Therefore, it’s
essential to create indexes thoughtfully based on your application’s query patterns.



Useful Admin Commands
db.products.createIndex({ name: 1 })                    // Ascending index on 'name' field
db.products.getIndexes()                               // List all indexes on 'products' collection
db.stats()                                            // Show DB stats
db.serverStatus()                                    // Server info
db.products.countDocuments()                        // Count documents
db.products.renameCollection("items")              // Rename collection
db.products.drop()                                // Drop collection
